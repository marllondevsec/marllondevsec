### 👤 Who I Am

I have been working with Information Technology professionally since 2021, with early and extensive exposure to operating systems and the fundamental principles of networked systems.

I am currently in the final semester of a Computer Science degree, where I found my path within the field of cybersecurity.

This profile is new and was rebuilt with the intention of better organization and the proper application of techniques that I only fully mastered later in my journey.

Today, my focus is on building a strong foundation in IT and security operations, with growing experience in system-level programming, security research, and practical labs, while preparing for entry-level opportunities in IT Support, SOC, NOC, or Infrastructure.
